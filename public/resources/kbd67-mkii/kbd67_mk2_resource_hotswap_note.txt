I originally designed both a hotswap and solderable variant PCB/plate for the 
KBD67 MKII.

The hotswap PCB was scrapped, replaced by KBDfans' own RGB hotswap PCB, and 
the plate modified to fit.

At this point, I do not have any idea which plate dimensions are correct for 
the retail version of the KBD67 MKII hotswap PCB, so I cannot provide a 
reliable plate file for it.
