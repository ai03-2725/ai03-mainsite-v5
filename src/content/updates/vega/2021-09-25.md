- The factory has been suffering from a major regional power shortage, which is forcing facility shutdowns and off-peak hour operations. This is having a crippling effect on the final stretch of Vega production; due to this, the new best-case ETA is end of October. If power shortages worsen, this may stretch further; any further delays will be reported here.  
- Order edits processing is nearing completion; a system to check final orders will be available once complete.
