As of the end of September, I have departed my position as a product designer at CannonKeys.


## But why?
Mainly wanting to explore more in life - after having keyboards front-and-center of my life for nearly 8 years, I have accomplished a lot of what I set out to do.  
With that, I wish to focus back on the reason why I started designing keyboards to begin with - using my own ideal work tool for contributing to the world via software.  
  
A huge thanks to the CannonKeys team for everything they've helped me achieve over the past three years and beyond - both on the fronts of keyboard development and software knowledge (an especially huge thanks to Upas on that part).  


## So where are the keyboards?
Multiple keyboards have been placed into CannonKeys' pipeline prior to departure - expect to hear more about them in the future in proper announcement posts.  
  
Specifically, the boards are `Photon`, `forge-c`, and `gemstone` (of which the latter two are non-final names) - all with very different goals which I've wanted to address for years.  
Of the three, Photon is the closest, and it tackles my long-standing goal of creating a keyboard for both the newcomer and experienced hobbyist alike - a trait made possible by its sheer versatility, performance, and accessibility.  
Expect to hear more about this one fairly soon (and if you're attending the next [Tokyo keyboard meetup](<https://tenkey.tokyo/en/>), you might see some units in person).  


## So you're quitting keyboards?
  
Nope - just switching back from full-time keyboard addict back to hobbyist independent designer.  
  
As such, any other projects that are in the works will continue to progress - whether they be keyboards like [Polaris V2](/projects/polaris-v2/) or community efforts like [Atelier](/designer-resources/).  
Currently running group buys will progress as usual.  

And knowing myself, I'll get the occasional uncontrollable itch to design a new keyboard for the rest of my life, so there'll probably be new designs for the foreseeable future.  


## The one remaining capstone

However, despite everything I've already done, I still have one massive keyboard goal left untouched.  

One which I cannot to walk away from unattempted.  
One which will be the culmination of everything I've learned over the past near-decade.  
One which, after all these years, will be my true endgame.  
  
Thus for at least a short while longer, I'll be tackling this goal before going full-time software.

Expect to hear more about it in the coming months.
