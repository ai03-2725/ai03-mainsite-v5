*Note: This is an old article written before the most recent site reconstruction.*
*Information may be out of date.*

ai03.com has been rewritten entirely for convenience and speed.

- Each keyboard project has its own proper page, with convenient access to images, updates, and downloads for each.
- Updates and downloads are now sortable by category and board.
- A news page has been added for announcements.
- The new site is built using Gatsby and Strapi for maintainability and speed.

From now on, both weekly and periodic announcements will be posted to this page.
