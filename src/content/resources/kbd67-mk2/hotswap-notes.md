label: "A note regarding the hotswap variant"
---
I originally designed both a hotswap and solderable variant PCB/plate for the KBD67 MKII.  

The hotswap PCB was scrapped, replaced by KBDfans' own RGB hotswap PCB, and the plate modified to fit.  

Due to this, I do not have the final plate files for the KBD67 MKII hotswap variant; please contact KBDfans for it instead.
