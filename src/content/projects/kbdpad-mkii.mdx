      ### Humble Beginnings
      In late 2018, custom keyboard availability was very grim.  
      Constantly available products were limited in design or quality.  
      Group buys had high barriers to entry in both cost and connections for joining.  
        
      To make higher quality keyboards available for all, I partnered with KBDfans to fully overhaul their first generation KBD8X tenkeyless design.  
      Alongside the main keyboard, I also decided to revise their KBDPAD with a design to match.

    ### Minimal and elegant
    Just like the KBD8X MKII, the KBDPAD MKII borrowed from the earlier [Lunar](/projects/lunar) design to implement a seamless exterior.  
    A neutral design language was chosen, allowing the keyboard to pair well with any keyset.  

    The brass weight installed on the KBD8X MKII was skipped on the KBDPAD MKII due to cost constraints and questionable benefits in such a small size.

    ### A keyboard-grade numpad
    The KBDPAD MKII implemented nearly identical internals to the larger KBD8X MKII design - a top-mounted plate structure and all, shrunken down to numpad size.

    In an era where quality internals could be difficult to have even on a larger keyboard, the KBDPAD MKII transformed expectations of what could be available in smaller dimensions.

    ### PCBs done right
    At a time when PCBs were often poorly implemented or a mere afterthought even on full size keyboards, the KBD8X MKII put just as much care into its circuitry as with the larger KBD8X MKII, carrying USB-C, overcurrent protection, and ESD protection when competitors were usually equipped with USB mini.

    ### A perfect pair
    As described, the KBDPAD MKII was designed in tandem with the [KBD8X MKII](/projects/kbd8x-mkii), offering a perfectly matching keyboard for use along with the numpad.

        ### A Lasting Legacy
        From its launch in early 2019, the KBDPAD MKII served as an always-accessible premium numpad for years until its discontinuation.  
        Its highly-rated visual language common to the KBD8X MKII would serve as a starting point for developing the [Polaris](/projects/polaris), which would eventually turn into the Reference series of designs.
