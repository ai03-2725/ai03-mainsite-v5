        Blending the past with the present, Vector renews vintage keyboard elements with modern functions and stylings to create a distinctly retro board that blends into desk environments of the present.

          ### A Leap Across Time
          Large seams, tapered front ledges, rounded edges, large bezels, pen rails - Vector revives the elements of early keyboards and reshapes them to fit the modern.
          Use the default penrail matched to the case for an undeniably retro feel; swap it for an accent color to create an entirely new impression that pairs well with vibrant keysets.
        </ClassicImageTextBlock>

        <ClassicImageTextBlock src="/assets/projects/vector/img_0024_largesize.avif">
          ### Bold Brushstrokes
          An uniform visual seam journeys around the board's faces, defining the case parts and outlining the massive polished weight overlaid with accent laser engravings.
          With large, blocky faces that wrap around the keyboard's form with both a sense of roundness and overall sharpness, Vector blurs the lines between retro and current stylings.
        </ClassicImageTextBlock> 

        <ClassicImageTextBlock src="/assets/projects/vector/img_0029_largesize.avif">
          ### Classic, Timeless Internals
          Vector's homage to the past carries over to its internals with a plateless PCB-mount structure from early keyboards.
          With full gasket isolation from the case and internal case screws, Vector brings the early inspiration to custom keyboard standards.
