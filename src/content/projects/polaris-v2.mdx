        In 2019, we changed the keyboard scene forever with the release of Polaris, bringing much-acclaimed typing acoustics and comfort in an accessible package which holds its own even today.  
        Fast-forward three years, and Polaris is back - retaining everything that made the original legendary, while redesigning it thoroughly to stand yet again as a reference against ever-evolving standards.

          ### Top-Tier Typing For All
          Polaris V2 brings the battle-tested fully isolated gasket-mounted internals from Vega back to the original 60% form factor, with tweaks to further enhance acoustic performance while maintaining its absolute comfort for countless hours of usage.  
          With improvements to ease of assembly, Polaris V2 ensures that you can enjoy the input benefits regardless of keyboard experience.

          ### Reference Aesthetic Outside and In
          The proven elegant, clean, and minimal exterior free of any visible screws has received much-needed modernization from Vega, while quietly improving internally for streamlined manufacturing and simplified assembly.  
          Along with its matte PVD-coated stainless steel weight, Polaris V2's visuals are designed to withstand the test of time, carrying its elegance forward many decades while blending seamlessly into any environment.

          ### To Fulfill Your Desires
          Every custom keyboard is different, and Polaris V2 is designed to be different - with multiple plate options, optional hotswap standoffs, and three optional layers of internal foam, you can tune Polaris V2 exactly the way you desire, ranging from anywhere between switch choice tester to dialed-in finalized build.  
          Every small detail was designed with much care to make Polaris V2 your ideal keyboard, down to the custom-designed screws, custom-designed rubber feet, and accent logo on the rear.

          ### Hassle-Free and Extensible
          The thin, flex-slotted hotswap PCB comes ready-to-go out of the box with VIA Configurator compatible firmware, requiring no soldering or driver headaches to assemble.  
          A solderable PCB kit is available for those who prefer to tailor the layout exactly to their preferences, and a much-requested replaceable USB daughterboard aids in extending the lifespan of the board.

          ### Prepared For What's Next
          A lot has changed since 2019 when Polaris V1 was announced - the keyboard community has grown exponentially, the world has changed permanently, and keyboard variety has skyrocketed.  
          We've combined both everything we've learned as well as brand-new knowledge to create the successor of the board which started our journey. Albeit against high expectations, we're confident that Polaris V2 will fit in as a faithful member of your keyboard collection both for the present and for the future - whether as your single endgame build or among a family of other boards.
