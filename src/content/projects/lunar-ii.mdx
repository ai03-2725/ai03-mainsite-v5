          ### A Worthy Successor
          Lunar II takes user feedback into mind as it improves upon the first generation design.  
          The curvature has been refreshed completely to reduce the front ledge height for easier typing, and the 1.2mm aluminum plate balances typing comfort, acoustics, and ease of assembly.  
          A weight has been added for additional heft and aesthetic accent while retaining the low typing angle.
        </ClassicImageTextBlock>

        <ClassicImageTextBlock src="/images/lunar-ii/lunar-ii-silver-front-large.avif">
          ### Zero-Seam Design
          Whereas the original Lunar hid the seam on the bottomside, Lunar II removes the seam completely with a single-piece case, with nothing to break the continuous smooth curvature.  
          A carefully engineered mounting method secures the plate to the case via O-ring-tipped standoffs, allowing for maximized flex on the typing surface without the stiffness of a typical tray mount.

        <ClassicImageTextBlock src="/images/lunar-ii/lunar-ii-proto-solenoid-large.avif">
          ### Making Noise
          Solenoid support allows for audible feedback at will.
          Use the electromagnetic hammer to add clickiness to tactile or linear switch without changing feel, or supplement and amplify the sound of clicky switches to a further level.
          When in need of quiet, simply toggle the solenoid off. 
        </ClassicImageTextBlock> 

        <ClassicImageTextBlock src="/images/lunar-ii/lunar-ii-diagonal-cropped-large.avif" >
          ### Alps For All
          The Lunar II brings the mini-AEK form to a more affordable price point with easier assembly.  
          Lunar II only requires a single Apple Extended Keyboard's worth of keycaps and stabilizers to build, making the task of sourcing parts much easier than the original.  
          Choose between the unified and split backspace plate options to tailor the build to your needs.
