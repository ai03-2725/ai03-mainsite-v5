          ### The Beauty and the Beast
          Designed as a cost-no-object keyboard, Andromeda’s sculpted side profiles have been modelled to provide a satin fabric-like elegance, which combined with the soft curvatures used throughout the board give a delicate feel which lead the eyes throughout the design.  
          Strong straight horizontals strike a heavy contrast to the softer elements to offer the bold, rigid impression to accompany the elegance. The careful balance of both constructs an elegant yet minimal, graceful yet powerful aesthetic fit for any environment.

        <ClassicImageTextBlock src="/images/andromeda/andromeda-side-bottom-medium.avif">
          ### The Journey to the Peak
          The design knowledge acquired through many of ai03’s designs in the past have been put forth to full effect with Andromeda, taking elements such as the rear-angled weight and gasket mounting of Polaris and refining them to their ultimate levels.
        </ClassicImageTextBlock> 

        <ClassicImageTextBlock src="/images/andromeda/andromeda-weight-medium.avif">
          ### Commitment To Detail
          The small details make the biggest differences, and no detail has been left unchecked with Andromeda.
          Interior screws provides a beautiful screwless exterior that does not interfere with the overall form, and a USB daughterboard separate from the main PCB allows for replacing the USB connector in case it wears out.
