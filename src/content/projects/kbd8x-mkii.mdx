      ### Humble Beginnings
      In late 2018, custom keyboard availability was very grim.  
      Constantly available products were limited in design or quality.  
      Group buys had high barriers to entry in both cost and connections for joining.  
        
      To make higher quality keyboards available for all, I partnered with KBDfans to fully overhaul their first generation KBD8X tenkeyless design.  
      The goal was to bring the visuals and internals in-line with the higher-end market to a more accessible price point and availability.

    ### Minimal and elegant
    Taking learnings from the earlier [Lunar](/projects/lunar) design, seamless exterior design was applied to a more conventional MX-switch keyboard.  
    A neutral design language was chosen, allowing the keyboard to pair well with any keyset.  

    A classic brass bottom weight added stability and acoustic control while creating simple visual flair - a simple visual flair which was so difficult to obtain at the time.

    ### Tailor-ordered
    For the initial group buy sale, the top and bottom colors were individually selectable - offering a level of customizability never seen before in the world of custom keyboards.  
    Considering that the $300 price tag was exceptionally affordable against all competitors of the time, 

    Following the group buy, the design was turned into a permanent in-stock product, satisfying the demand for a constantly avaialble high-quality keyboard kit for years.

    ### An eye on internals
    The KBD8X MKII was one of the first affordable keyboards to push internals as a major feature, implementing classic top-mount internals with the plate screwed to the case top half at carefully chosen mount points.  
    
    The brass plates shown in the render showcases the trends of the time - a dense and rigid plate for acoustic benefits.

    ### PCBs done right
    At a time when PCBs were often poorly implemented or a mere afterthought, the KBD8X MKII put plenty of care into the circuitry - the PCB was robustly designed for reliable operation, and also revived custom flex-slotted geometry found in earlier keyboards to reduce the stiffness of the board.

    The USB connector was Type-C when the majority of competitors were still on USB mini, and also included overcurrent and ESD protection.

    ### A perfect pair
    The KBD8X MKII was designed in tandem with the [KBDPAD MKII](/projects/kbdpad-mkii), offering a perfectly matching numpad for use along with the keyboard.

        ### A Lasting Legacy
        From its launch in early 2019, the KBD8X MKII served as an always-accessible, premium yet affordable TKL for years until it was succeeded by a MKIII design created by another designer.  
        Its highly-rated visual language would serve as a starting point for developing the [Polaris](/projects/polaris), which would eventually turn into the Reference series of designs.  

        The [PCB design source](https://github.com/ai03-2725/KBD8X-MKII-PCB) still serves as a design reference and starting point for the keyboard design community.
