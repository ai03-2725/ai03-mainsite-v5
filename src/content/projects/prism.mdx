        A switch opener that's elegant on the desk and efficient in your hands.  
        The Prism switch opener combined the 2-in-1 opening teeth from the [keychain switch opener](/projects/keychain) with a unique, larger design that is easier to grip.

          ### The Switch Modding Multitool
          Countless prototypes were made to ensure that the single switch opener can open a wide variety of switches, including Cherry MX-style 4-clip, larger Panda-style housings, and 2-clip Kailh-style variants.

          ### An Elegant Solution
          The unique geometry of the Prism opener provides grip in the hand, while also serving as an artful object on the desk when not in use.  
          Magnetic closure protects the openerâ€™s teeth from damaging nearby objects.
