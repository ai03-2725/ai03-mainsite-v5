    ### So what's a custom keyboard anyways?
    
    Historically, "custom keyboards" has referred to higher-end keyboards designed to maximize quality, aesthetics, comfort, and acoustics.  
      
    In the past, they were quite a bit more exclusive than your typical keyboard - ranging all the way into the thousands of dollars and limited to private friends-only purchasing - but nowadays can be had far more affordably and accessibly.  
    
    One unique characteristic about custom keyboards is that they tend to come un-assembled - the user is expected to tune and dial in the build to their preferences, which makes these boards far more involved than simply buying and using.  

    ### Demystifying the keyboard

    It's always been a daunting task to get into the world of fully custom keyboards due to the sheer amount of knowledge involved - this guide aims to remove that barrier to entry.  
    After all, there's a whole world out there to explore, as well as your true endgame keyboard waiting for you somewhere out there.
