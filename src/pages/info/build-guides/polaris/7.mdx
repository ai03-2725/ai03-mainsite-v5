    ## Further tuning, support, and feedback

    ### Further acoustic tuning
    We found some new acoustic info after starting production, so we weren't able to get these changes into the final product.

    Here's what we suggest:
    - Tape the PCB flex slot that cuts across the middle shut with electrical tape or similar so that it is completely sealed.
    - Similarly, do the same for the flex cuts in the plate, along with any switch positions that are unused.  
    
    ### Support
    For when things are not going well, reach out to the following places.

    - For **logistical** issues such as damage/loss during transit, incorrect order contents, etc., contact KBDfans. 

    - For **assembly** help regarding building, flashing, etc., the best way is to check the [FAQ](https://info.ai03.me/shelves/faq) and to drop by [ai03's Discord server](https://discord.gg/qA5JD9y) for live community support. I won't always be there to respond, but usually someone will know the answer to the question.

    - If it gets to the point where nobody knows the solution, either ping @ai03#2725 in the Discord server, or DM after sending a friend request. Emailing admin@ai03.com will also work, but I may miss the email or be very slow to respond in comparison to Discord.
