    ## Keymap editing and closing words

    Keymap editing on the Andromeda is possible in just a few clicks.
    - If you have a recent version of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or any browser that supports WebUSB/WebHID, [Remap](https://remap-keys.app/) can be used to edit the keymap directly from your browser.
    - If you prefer to use a local tool, the standalone [Via Configurator](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases/) can be installed.

    ## Carrying case conversion

    To convert the carrying case from packaging mode to functional mode, do the following:

    1. Remove the PCB tray from the case.

    2. Move the accessories bin lid from the PCB tray to the main compartment.

    When using the carrying case, make sure that the keyboard is securely installed via the velcro straps and that any loose items that can potentially damage the keyboard are secured.  
    If storing for extended amounts of time, it may be best to wrap the keyboard in a colorless plastic bag or similar to avoid color transfer from the foam or similar onto the case.

    ## Closing words

    Once again, thank you for your purchase, and we hope that Vega serves as a reliable keyboard for years to come.
