    ## Thank you for your purchase!

    ####  Assembly Instructions

    1. Disassemble the case; remove parts from packaging.
    2. Assemble the internals.   

    A: If you are building plateless (recommended configuration):
        <div class="p-4 bg-zinc-100 rounded-[3.75px]">
        1. Solder switches onto the PCB, making sure that each one is making firm contact against the PCB surface.
        2. Install stabilizers.
        3. Mount keycaps onto each switch and check for any excessively rotated switches.  
          If any exist, resolder as necessary, or simply twist the switch while heating/melting the solder joints and letting them re-form.  
          Remove keycaps near the case screw points once done.  
        4. Plug the PCB into a computer and test functionality.  
          Make any soldering repairs as necessary.  
        </div>
      
    B: If you are using the plate (for 3-pin switches and depending on preferences):
        <div class="p-4 bg-zinc-100 rounded-[3.75px]">
        1. Install stabilizers onto the PCB.
        2. Snap switches into the corner positions of the plate.
        3. Insert the plate-switch assembly onto the PCB.
        4. Install the rest of the switches onto the plate, making sure that each one is snapped in properly.
        5. Solder all switches, making sure that each one is making firm contact against the PCB surface.
          *Double-check to be sure that stabilizers are installed before this step.*
        6. Plug the PCB into a computer and test functionality.  
          Make any soldering repairs as necessary.  
        </div>

    3. Install the gasket pads onto the case bottom half in the locations shown.

      ![Gasket locations](/images/build-guides/equinox-xl/equinox-xl-gasket-pads-post-install.png)
      
    4. Lower the internals assembly (PCB, switches, optionally plate) onto the bottom, making sure the PCB tabs land onto the gasket pads in the process.

    5. Lower the case top onto the assembly.

    6. Install the 6 case screws from the gaps between the switches.  
      Take care to avoid scratching the inner walls of the case while securing the screws.

    Congratulations!  
    You have assembled an Equinox XL.  

    ### Configuring the Keymap

    Use [VIA](https://usevia.app/) to configure the keymap.  
    Until [this pull request](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards/pull/2326/) is merged, manual loading of the VIA definition JSON is necessary for the board to detect.  

    1. Download the necessary files:   
        <a href="/resources/equinox-xl/equinox_xl_via_v2.json" download="equinox_xl_via_v2.json">VIA JSON V2</a> - if you're using the PCB as-is without having flashed newer firmware on it  
        <a href="/resources/equinox-xl/equinox_xl_via_v3.json" download="equinox_xl_via_v3.json">VIA JSON V3</a> - if you've installed a recently compiled version of QMK on the PCB  
    2. Open VIA configurator, navigate to the settings menu on the top bar, and enable the "Show design tab" option.  
    3. Switch to the new design tab that appears on the top bar.  
    4. If you are using V2 definitions, enable the "Use V2 definitions" option.  
    5. Click the load button beside "Load Draft Definition", and select the JSON file downloaded earlier.  
    6. At this point, the board should detect in VIA when plugged in.
