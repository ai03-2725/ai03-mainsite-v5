    ## Keymap editing and closing words

    The key to getting the most out of your Lunar II is to tune the keymap to your liking.  
    Thankfully, this can be done in a few clicks.  
      
    1. Open Via Configurator.

        1. If you are using a WebHID-compatible browser such as Chrome or Edge, visit [usevia.app](https://usevia.app/) and authorize access to the keyboard.
        2. Otherwise, download and install [Via Configurator](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases/) if not already done.  
          If the installation is from a while ago, install the latest copy.  


    2. Launch Via Configurator, and plug in the Lunar II if not done already.  
      The board should detect automatically.

    3. Switch the layout options under the layout tab and switch the backspace layout if necessary.

    4. Switch back to the keymap tab.  
      Click the key location to change, and click a key from the list below to write the new keycode in.  
      This can be done for all layers as needed; switch between them as necessary using the layer toggles above the keymap view.  

    Some useful keycodes for layer switching:  

    - MO(x) momentarily switches to a layer, similar to how holding shift allows for entering capital letters while it is held.
    - TO(x) switches to a specific layer permanently. This may be useful for completely varying layers.
    
    A full list of keycodes can be found in the [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keycodes).

    A list of keycodes used for solenoid control can be found [here](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_haptic_feedback?id=haptic-keycodes).

    By default, the solenoid dwell time is set to 15ms, which is just enough to fully extend the model used in the board without causing excess heat and energy use. It is recommended to keep this dwell time as-is unless your solenoid has trouble fully extending; in such case, it is not recommended to extend dwell time beyond 25ms for the sake of heat.

    ## Closing words

    Once again, thank you for your purchase, and we hope that Lunar II serves as a reliable keyboard for years to come.  

    If you ever need support, please contact us at the following:  

    - For **logistical** issues such as damage/loss during transit, incorrect order contents, etc., contact Switchplate Peripherals or TypePlus. 

    - For **assembly** help regarding building and similar, first check the [FAQ](/info/faq/) and to drop by [ai03's Discord server](https://discord.gg/qA5JD9y) for live community support. I won't always be there to respond, but usually someone will know the answer to the question.

    - If it gets to the point where nobody knows the solution, either ping @ai03#2725 in the Discord server, or send me DM after joining the server. Emailing admin@ai03.com will also work, but I may miss the email or be very slow to respond in comparison to Discord.
