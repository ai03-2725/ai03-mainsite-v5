    ## Final assembly and combined testing

    1. Install the provided rubber feet into the indents on the bottom of the case (if not done already).  

    2. With both halves disconnected from any computer or device, connect the **inner USB ports** (the ones near spacebar, not the ones near Esc/Backspace) of the two halves together using the provided USB cable.  
      Then, connect the outer USB port of the half you prefer to a computer, and test that the keys on both halves function for sending keystrokes.  
        
      **Warning:** Only one of the outer USB ports should be used at once - do not connect both ports to the computer, each port to a different computer, etc., as this will likely cause irrepairable damage to both the keyboard and the computers involved.  

    3. Install keycaps of your choice.


    Your Altair(-X) build is now complete.

    ## The Learning Guide
    
    I apologize for how long the build guide took to publish - I'm currently wrapping up the learning guide portion, and I hope to have it done hopefully by the end of the day, worst case by the end of the week.
