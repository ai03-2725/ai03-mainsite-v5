    ## Pre-build preparations
    Before assembling the board, there are a few things to check.

    1. Briefly check the exterior of the case to make sure that there's no damage or whatnot (unless you purchased a B-stock unit or similar unit with known defects).

        1. If you have any major flaws on the case that require a replacement, **do not continue further** and contact the vendor you purchased from immediately.  
          RMA requests can't be handled if the board has been built, so keep everything unused.

    2. If you skipped through it, double-check that all package contents listed in part 1 are actually included in the box.  
      It's a nightmare if you get partway through the build and realize a part is missing.

    <br />
    
    Once you've confirmed that the board is ready for assembly, it's time to assemble.
