    ## Assembling the internals

    1. Prepare the following parts:

        - One of the plates (they are reversible, so the left/right half plates are identical),  
        - The PCB for the left hand side,  
        - A foam midlayer if you purchased one and plan to use it,  
        - The screws and gaskets,  
        - The switches you'll be using for the build.  
        
        ![Label locations](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154040374.avif)

        The PCB can be identified by the "LHS" (left-hand side) marker located here.
        ![PCB marker](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154045294-annotated.avif)

    2. Place down three switches, then place the PCB atop to float it in the air.
      ![Switches](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154836623.avif)
      ![PCB atop](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154842441.avif)

    3. Fit 5 of the provided "Shoulder Screws" (the screws with a small column between its head and threaded bit) into the 5 circled holes.  
      ![Shoulder screw](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154903503.avif)
      ![Screw locations](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154916231-annotated.avif)

    4. If you are using the foam midlayer, stack it atop the PCB and align it into place.
      ![Midfoam](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154937095.avif)

    5. Separately, prepare the plate by installing 6 switches around the corners.  
      The photo below shows the recommended switch locations.
      ![Switches into the plate](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154420684.avif)
        
        Verify that all 6 switches have straight pins - if you spot any bends like the ones below, bend them back into shape.
        <div class="flex flex-row max-w-[800px]">
          <img src="/images/build-guides/vega/vega-build-guide-4-8-1.png" />
          <img src="/images/build-guides/vega/vega-build-guide-4-8-2.png" />
        </div>

    6. Place this plate-switch assembly onto the PCB-screws assembly, then push them together.
        ![Combining the plate and PCB](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-154953949.avif)
        
        Once assembled, check the following:
          - The plate and PCB should be pushed all the way together, with the switches both clipped into the plate and making firm contact against the PCB.  
        ![Fully pushed together](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-155014924.avif)

          - The two pins of each switch have successfully made it through each socket, rather than being bent out of shape and crumping against them.
        ![Visible switch pins](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-155028241-annotated.avif)

          - All five shoulder screws are now captive between the plate and PCB.  
        ![Screws visible from the bottom](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-155033596-annotated.avif)
        ![Screws visible from the top](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-155047939-annotated.avif)
      
    7. Install the remaining switches.  
      For each switch, verify that the switch pins are not bent, and insert them all the way until they clip into the plate and make firm contact against the PCB.  
      ![Switches being installed](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-155203809.avif)
      ![Switches installed](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-155350986.avif)

    8. Flip the assembly upside-down.  
      Install the large gaskets into the locations shown below (marked with rectangles labelled "Gasket A" on the PCB).
      ![Gasket locations](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-160228543-annotated-large.avif)

      ![Gasket installed](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-160311285.avif)

    9. Install the small/thin gasket into the location shown below (marked with a rectangle labelled "Gasket B" on the PCB).
      ![Gasket location](/images/build-guides/altair/altair-build-guide-20241022-160353522-labelled.avif)

    <br />
    
    The internals assembly is now complete.  
    It is now time to put it all together.
