        ## Currently Under Construction

        First of all, I apologize for the guide not being complete yet.

        I had queued my tasks to complete this by the time Altair shipped, but did not receive any notice that they had shipped until hearing from the buyers directly; I am currently working through the weekend to complete this and hope to have it done before next week.
