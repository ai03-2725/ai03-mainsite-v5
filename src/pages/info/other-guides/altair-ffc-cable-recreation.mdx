        # Altair(-X) FFC Cable Folding Guide
        If you ever need a replacement FFC for the Altair(-X), you can easily fold an off-the-shelf unit into the needed shape.  

        ## Sourcing the FFC
        Find a FFC/FPC/ribbon cable with the following specifications:

        - 0.3mm thickness at the ends (usually just denoted as a 0.3mm thick FFC)
        - 0.5mm pitch
        - 8-pin
        - 120mm length
        - Reverse-ends (Type B) with the blue tape on different sides at the ends rather than both on the same side

        An example listing for such a FFC can be found [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000022066634.html) - make sure to select the correct length (120mm), type (B), and pitch (0.5mm).  

        ## Folding the FFC

        Simply fold the cable so that the short end is roughly 25mm from the end to the outer side of the bend, recreating the shape of the stock cable.
