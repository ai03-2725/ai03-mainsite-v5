    ## The power-user jump

    So you're desiring a bit more from layers, and have decided to explore this topic.  

    <br/>

    ### The simplest path

    First, back up your current layout in VIA configurator by exporting it and saving it somewhere safe.  
    Then, download <a href="/resources/altair/altair-to-altair-x-conversion.layout.json" download="altair-next-step.layout.json">this layout</a>, and apply it by loading it in VIA configurator.  
    
    ### What happened?

    Your Altair just became an Altair-X.  
    From here, you can simply jump to the [Altair-X learning guide from the layouts and layers page](/info/other-guides/altair-x-learning-guide/3/), and gain all of the info you need for taking your Altair to the next level.  


    ### Further optimizations 

    Once you follow the guide and pick up the 4-row-heavy layer techniques, you might be wondering what to do with the now-unused numrow.  
    Here are some recommendations:  
    - Make it a dedicated Fn key row instead for quick access.  
    - Bind it to the shifted versions of the numrow keys for quick symbol input.  
    - Bind them to macros for your commonly used programs.  
    - Assign media control keys to them.  
    - Use them for layer switching to rarely-used layers.  

    ### Reverting the changes

    If you want to restore the factory Altair layout, you can do so by applying <a href="/resources/altair/altair-stock.layout.json" download="altair-stock.layout.json">this layout</a> via VIA configurator.  

    <br />
    
    And with this, the learning guide for the 5-row Altair ends here.  

    Once again, thank you for choosing the Altair/Altair-X - it is the current culmination of my journey to the endgame keyboard, and I hope that my efforts reflect in its function and performance.  
    Your trust in the project allowed it to come to life, and I offer the deepest gratitude for making this project possible.
