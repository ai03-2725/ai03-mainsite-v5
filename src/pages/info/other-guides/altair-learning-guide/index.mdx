    ## So you now have an Altair.
    (or are considering obtaining one.)

    <br/>
      
    Most companies would probably leave you stranded at this point - now that they have your money, it's not their problem.  
      
    But I'm not most companies, so I'm here to make sure that you can actually use your Altair.  
    
    <br />
    
    After all, improving the typing experience is my passion.
    
      
    ## What does it take?
    When I made the jump to ergo for the first time, it was directly from a massive tenkeyless to a 40% ergo known as the Orbit-X.  
      
    The physical layout wasn't as optimized as the Altair being one of my earlier attempts, and I also had to create a usable keymap from scratch during the transition.  
      
    Even with those difficulties, I was able to make the transition to survivable WPM in roughly a week, and was back to roughly regular typing speed after a month.  

    <br/>
    
    With Altair, I've poured in my learnings into the default keymap to make the transition as painless as possible, and the physical layout has been through far more refinement.  
      
    My estimate is that a full transition (back to original row-stagger typing speed) should be possible in roughly a month or less.  
    
    <br/>
    
    I'll be honest and say the migration won't miraculously happen overnight - the initial few days especially will be a challenge.  
      
    However, once you overcome the initial challenge, you'll be greeted with the comfort of nearly zero wrist-movement as you type - with all of of the accuracy and speed benefits that it brings.  
      
    My personal recommendation is to try to use nothing but Altair for the initial week or two - it'll help dial in your muscle memory, and once it's in place it'll be easy to swap back and forth between regular layouts.  

    <br/>

    So, let's get started.
