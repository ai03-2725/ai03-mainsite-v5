        # Alps SKCM/SKCL Switch Cleaning
        Alps SKCM/SKCL switches feel questionable when not maintained.  
        Here's how to get them back into perfect shape.  

        ## Disassembly
        1. Pull the tabs that secure the top housing to the bottom housing outwards, and pull the top housing up out of the bottom housing.
        2. Remove the stem, spring, and click leaf from the housing.
        3. The contact plate can be removed if needed, mainly by pushing the legs side to pop them out.
          They can be left in if not in terrible condition.
        
        ## Cleaning the housing
        1. Take the top housing, and optionally the bottom housing if you decided to remove the contact plates from them, and remove any massive chunks of dust.
        2. Place them into an ultrasonic cleaner.  
          **Warning:** Do not ultrasonic-clean the bottoms with the contact plates still included - water will ingress into them and corrode over time.
        3. Run the ultrasonic cleaner for 3-5 minutes.
        4. Take them out, dry completely.
        
        ## Cleaning the stems
        1. Place them into an ultrasonic cleaner.
        2. Run the cleaning for 3-5 minutes.
        3. Take them out, dry completely.
        
        ## Cleaning the click leaves
        1. Make sure ultrasonic cleaner is completely clean, without residue.
        2. Fill the cleaner with distilled water, rather than any water.
        3. Clean leaves in ultrasonic cleaner for 3-5 minutes.
        4. Dry quickly, getting rid of moisture using a thin towel without bending the leaves out of shape.
        5. Air-dry completely.
        
        ## Other parts
        - Contact plate can be wiped down with isopropyl alcohol. 
          Take care to make sure moisture does not enter the complex structure and cause rusting.
        
        - Springs can be cleaned with ultrasonic cleaners as well. 
          Follow the same instructions as the click leaves.
        
        ## Reassembly, the easy way
        
        1. If you removed the contact plates from bottom housing, reinsert them into the bottom housing by pressing on the top edge of the plate.  
          Take care so that the bent metal part of the backside of the contact plate does not get bent out of shape by the clips on the bottom housing.
        2. Verify that there is no dust on the top housing, and place it upside down.  
          Insert stem into top housing so cut side faces contact plate side. (Contact plate side of top housing has a cut notch/groove)
        3. Insert click leaf between stem and top housing.
        4. Insert spring into stem.
        5. Insert bottom housing-contact plate structure so that the contact plate fits between the stem and the top housing. 
        6. Clip housing shut.
        7. Click the switch a few times to verify that the switch is working.
        8. Test switch with multimeter.
