				### Quick Support
				Please join [the Discord community](https://discord.gg/qA5JD9y) for the quickest support and real-time discussion.  
				I am the most responsive if contacted there, and there may also be community assistance available.

				### Commissions
				Commission requests are currently not accepted due to limited capacity.  

				### Business and Media Inquiries
				Since I am purely a designer, I do not carry any inventory; I am unable to handle business-to-business purchasing requests, review sample distribution, or similar as a result.  
				For such inquiries, please contact the vendor in question.
				
				### General Inquiries
				For questions or messages that involve private information, or larger inquiries beyond the scope of Discord, please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDXYrYGG9i69_cJkETaZZj6OcjNraM9qaULQIhStfAcz5hfQ/viewform) for reaching out.
